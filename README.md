# Desk: An Office Suite for a Modern Workforce

### THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.
Desk is an open-source office suite that attempts to bridge the gap between existing freeware and premium Office software, from Microsoft's Office programs to Google's G Suite. 

Desk is focused first and foremost on efficient collaboration. This is old news - almost every organization building business-oriented software in the modern age is focused on the buzzwords of "collaboration", "sharing", etc. Often, though, it feels as though collaboration is an afterthought or add-on, rather than an integral part of the product. Even worse, many products make collaboration a "premium" feature that should only be available to people who can afford to pay for it.

Secondly, Desk is focused on refining what already makes current offerings great. This isn't a reinvention of the wheel, and why should it be? Smart people have put heaps of time into designing the modern office suite. However, the motivation for this project arose from the fact that no office application does everything right - Microsoft's Office excels when it comes to giving users several tools to customize their products, but often falls short when it comes to effortless collaboration, and it's online application is emaciated. Meanwhile, Google's G Suite nails so many aspects of collaboration and ease of use, but feels feature-light in comparison to MS Office - more than once, one finds themselves switching between the two (or more) to balance this mismatched set of tools. 

Finally, Desk is focused on community involvement. Unlike the aforementioned offerings, Desk provides (and will always provide) its source code to the public and can be freely modified and investigated by the public. The goal here is to provide a foundation for user-made extensions and plugins to take the mainstage, rather than expect the project itself to pump out new features at the speed of light. To that end, Desk provides a developer toolkit for those interesting in extending the product, complete with a UI toolkit to provide drop-in components that look native to the core software.

### What about LibreOffice/OpenOffice/other open-source office application?

It would be a mistake to avoid mentioning the already existing office software that serves millions of users worldwide already.
